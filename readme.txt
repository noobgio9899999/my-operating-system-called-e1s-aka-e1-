bruh
also you have to install 7zip
and then right click on the encrypted.7z files
and then click 7zip
and then click open archive
and then click on the first file the system one
and right click
and click open
and it should show enter pasword
and type password123
if that does not work type archive
and try both for both files
Also if ur lazy and ont want to do all of that there is also the real code file and they are not in compressed things
